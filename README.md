# Cider Remote (Unofficial)

An unofficial remote for Cider player that works on VSCode.

## How to use

Cider Remote for VSCode requires Cider player to be opened in the background

It uses Cider's Rest API for the playback controls and thus requires and internet connection.

You can use this extension thru command pallet or by clicking on the Cider logo on the sidebar.

## Notice
